    <p>Wing Chun is a close range striking art developed in the late
      17th century in Southern China that employs the philosophy of a
      centerline as a mode of attack and emphasizes “sticking“ to your
      opponent to control and dismantle structure. This is done through
      countless hours of sensitivity training, conditioning and
      building proper structure. It emphasizes bone structure and
      physics over strength and thus has been touted as a perfect system
      for people of smaller stature.

    <p>I started training Wing Chun in the summer of 2010. I had been looking for a
      good teacher for a long time and by the time I found someone, I was
      told he had moved back to San Diego. Luckily he still had a student in
      Sarasota by the name of Gabe Hernandez that had talked of starting up his
      own class. I began training under Gabe, and he would soon become one of
      my good friends. Then a year or so later his teacher, Rene, moved back
      into town, and I have been learning from him ever since. Rene is a second
      generation Yip Man disciple. For those that are not familiar with Yip Man
      (shown above), he was Bruce Lee’s first teacher and is considered to be the gold standard
      of Wing Chun practitioners. Many lineages will trace themselves back to him. There have
      been countless films in recent years made about him highlighting his life
      and the surrounding prestige. Most of it is exaggerated and overly dramatic,
      but you get the idea. His top disciple was a man named Ho Kam Ming, and one of
      Ho Kam Ming’s top students is Rene Ng, my teacher.
