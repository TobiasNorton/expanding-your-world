    <p>According to Yip Man, the story of Wing Chun
      was developed by a Buddhist nun by the name of
      Ng Mui in the 17th century after the destruction of
      the Henan Shaolin Monastery. She fled to the White Crane
      temple where she met a young girl by the name of Yim
      Wing-Chun who was being forced into marriage by a
      local bandit. Ng Mui taught Yim Wing Chun a style she
      had developed for practitioners to learn quickly
      and without much strength. This style was a stripped
      down version of the Snake and Crane styles and focused
      on economy of motion. She named the style after Yim Wing-Chun.
